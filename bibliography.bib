    for a large class of possible configurations, they can be classified into five types, characterized by generic

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate different possible strategies underlying the formation of human locomotor
    trajectories in goal-directed walking. Seven subjects were asked to walk within a motion capture facility from a
      fixed starting point and direction, and to cross over distant porches for which both position and direction in
      the room were changed over trials. Stereotyped trajectories were observed in the different subjects. The
      underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control scheme: the
      trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject
      being viewed as a controlled system, we tried to identify several criteria that could be optimized. Is it the
      time to perform the trajectory? The length of the path? The minimum jerk along the path? We found that the
      variation (time derivative) of the curvature of the locomotor paths is minimized. Moreover, we show that the
      human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the norm
      of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose
      curvature grows with the distance from the origin.},

  abstract={A simple and efficient randomized algorithm is presented for solving single-query path planning problems in
    high-dimensional configuration spaces. The method works by incrementally building two rapidly-exploring random
      trees (RRTs) rooted at the start and the goal configurations. The trees each explore space around them and also
      advance towards each other through, the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan
      motions for a human arm (modeled as a 7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of
      collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path
      planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 3D,
    and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3D workspace. Some basic theoretical analysis is
      also presented},

    Since the work of Tad McGeer in the late 1980s, the  concept of passive dynamics has added insight into animal
      locomotion and the design  of anthropomorphic robots.  Various analyses and machines that demonstrate efficient
      human-like walking have been developed using this strategy. Human-like passive  machines, however, have only
      operated in two dimensions (i.e., within the fore-aft  or sagittal plane). Three-dimensional passive walking
      devices, mostly toys, have not  had human-like motions but instead a stiff legged waddle.  In the present
      three-dimensional device, the authors preserve features of McGeer’s two-dimensional models, including mechanical
      simplicity, human-like knee flexure,  and passive gravitational power from descending a shallow slope. They then
      add  specially curved feet, a compliant heel, and mechanically constrained arms to achieve a harmonious and
      stable gait. The device stands 85 cm tall. It weighs 4.8  kg, walks at about 0.51 m/s down a 3.1-degree slope,
    and consumes 1.3 W. This robot  further implicates passive dynamics in human walking and may help point the way
      toward simple and efficient robots with human-like motions.},

      cycle, its stability, and its sensi tivity to parameter variations are easily calculated. Experi ments with a

      clearly demonstrated by a machine powered only by gravity, but they can be combined easily with active energy
      input to produce efficient and dextrous walking over a broad range of terrain.},

    walk stably down a slope. They have no motors or controllers, yet can have remarkably humanlike motions. This
      suggests that these machines are useful models of human locomotion; however, they cannot walk on level ground.
      Here we present three robots based on passive-dynamics, with small active power sources substituted for gravity,
    which can walk on level ground. These robots use less control and less energy than other powered robots, yet walk
      more naturally, further suggesting the importance of passive-dynamics in human locomotion.},

  abstract = {This is the first study of a real physical kneed bipedal robot that exhibits passive dynamic running
    (PDR). Passive dynamic walking (PDW), which has its roots in the pioneering research of McGeer, intrinsically
      offers not only nonlinear phenomena such as the pull-in effect and period-doubling bifurcation, but also offers
      an extremely interesting phenomenon that facilitates the engineering of a highly efficient walking robot. In
      recent years, a wide variety of verification experiments in PDW were performed using actual devices. In contrast,
    however, very few studies addressed PDR. In the present study, we developed a two-dimensional real physical passive
      dynamic running biped with knees. The device stands 400 mm tall and weights 4.8 kg. By carefully designing the
      properties of the elastic elements implemented into the hip joints and the stance legs in the present device, we
      achieved stable passive dynamic running of 36 steps.  The device runs at about 0.83 m/s down a 0.22 rad slope. To
      the best of our knowledge, this is a first report of such a performance. This result is expected to prove useful
      not only for designing human-like natural and efficient bipedal robots, but also for understanding the principles
      underlying bipedal locomotion.},

      robot is interesting because although it is theoretically challenging (4 degrees of under-actuation), the
      mechanical design of the robot made it relatively easy to create controllers which allowed the robot to walk

  abstract = {During human walking, the center of pressure under the foot progresses forward smoothly during each step,
    creating a wheel-like motion between the leg and the ground. This rolling motion might appear to aid walking
      economy, but the mechanisms that may lead to such a benefit are unclear, as the leg is not literally a wheel. We
      propose that there is indeed a benefit, but less from rolling than from smoother transitions between
      pendulum-like stance legs. The velocity of the body center of mass (COM) must be redirected in that transition,
    and a longer foot reduces the work required for the redirection. Here we develop a dynamic walking model that
      predicts different effects from altering foot length as opposed to foot radius, and test it by attaching rigid,
    arc-like foot bottoms to humans walking with fixed ankles. The model suggests that smooth rolling is relatively
      insensitive to arc radius, whereas work for the step-to-step transition decreases approximately quadratically
      with foot length. We measured the separate effects of arc-foot length and radius on COM velocity fluctuations,
    work performed by the legs and metabolic cost. Experimental data (N=8) show that foot length indeed has much
      greater effect on both the mechanical work of the step-to-step transition (23\% variation, P=0.04) and the
      overall energetic cost of walking (6\%, P=0.03) than foot radius (no significant effect, P\&gt;0.05). We found
      the minimum metabolic energy cost for an arc foot length of approximately 29\% of leg length, roughly comparable
      to human foot length. Our results suggest that the foot{\textquoteright}s apparently wheel-like action derives
      less benefit from rolling per se than from reduced work to redirect the body COM.},

  abstract="Neuroscientific studies show that humans tend to stabilize their head orientation, while accomplishing a
    locomotor task. This is beneficial to image stabilization and in general to keep a reference frame for the body. In
    robotics, too, head stabilization during robot walking provides advantages in robot vision and gaze-guided
    locomotion. In order to obtain the head movement behaviors found in human walk, it is necessary and sufficient to
    be able to control the orientation (roll, pitch and yaw) of the head in space. Based on these principles, three
    controllers have been designed. We developed two classic robotic controllers, an inverse kinematics based
    controller, an inverse kinematics differential controller and a bio-inspired adaptive controller based on feedback
    error learning.  The controllers use the inertial feedback from a IMU sensor and control neck joints in order to
    align the head orientation with the global orientation reference. We present the results for the head stabilization
    controllers, on two sets of experiments, validating the robustness of the proposed control methods. In particular,
  we focus our analysis on the effectiveness of the bio-inspired adaptive controller against the classic robotic
    controllers. The first set of experiments, tested on a simulated robot, focused on the controllers response to a
    set of disturbance frequencies and a step function. The other set of experiments were carried out on the SABIAN
    robot, where these controllers were implemented in conjunction with a model of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)
    and opto-kinetic reflex (OKR). Such a setup permits to compare the performances of the considered head
    stabilization controllers in conditions which mimic the human stabilization mechanisms composed of the joint effect
    of VOR, OKR and stabilization of the head. The results show that the bio-inspired adaptive controller is more
    beneficial for the stabilization of the head in tasks involving a sinusoidal torso disturbance, and it shows
    comparable performances to the inverse kinematics controller in case of the step response and the locomotion
    experiments conducted on the real robot.",

  title={Proprioceptive actuator design in the MIT cheetah: Impact mitigation and high-bandwidth physical interaction for dynamic legged robots},
  year={2017},
  volume={33},
  number={3},
  pages={509-522},
  publisher={IEEE},
  abstract={Designing an actuator system for highly dynamic legged robots has been one of the grand challenges in
    robotics research. Conventional actuators for manufacturing applications have difficulty satisfying design
      requirements for high-speed locomotion, such as the need for high torque density and the ability to manage
      dynamic physical interactions. To address this challenge, this paper suggests a proprioceptive actuation paradigm
      that enables highly dynamic performance in legged machines. Proprioceptive actuation uses collocated force
      control at the joints to effectively control contact interactions at the feet under dynamic conditions. Modal
      analysis of a reduced leg model and dimensional analysis of DC motors address the main principles for
      implementation of this paradigm. In the realm of legged machines, this paradigm provides a unique combination of
      high torque density, high-bandwidth force control, and the ability to mitigate impacts through backdrivability.
      We introduce a new metric named the “impact mitigation factor” (IMF) to quantify backdrivability at impact, which
      enables design comparison across a wide class of robots. The MIT Cheetah leg is presented, and is shown to have
      an IMF that is comparable to other quadrupeds with series springs to handle impact. The design enables the
      Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over
      450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in
      high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation
      approach.},

  abstract = { The paper reports on two results issued from a multidisciplinary research action exploring the motor
    synergies of anthropomorphic walking. By combining the biomechanical, neurophysiology, and robotics perspectives,
    it is intended to better understand human locomotion with the ambition to better design bipedal robot
      architectures. The motivation of the research starts from the simple observation that humans may stumble when
      following a simple reflex-based locomotion on uneven terrains. The rationale combines two well established
      results in robotics and neuroscience, respectively:passive robot walkers, which are very efficient in terms of
      energy consumption, can be modeled by a simple rotating rimless wheel;humans and animals stabilize their head
      when moving. The seminal hypothesis is then to consider a wheel equipped with a stabilized mass on top of it as a
      plausible model of bipedal walking. The two results presented in the paper support the hypothesis.From a motion
      capture data basis of twelve human walkers, we show that the motions of the feet are organized around a geometric
      center, which is the center of mass, and is surprisingly not at the hip.After introducing a ground texture model
      that allows us to quantify the stability performance of walker control schemes, we show how compass-like passive
      walkers are better controlled when equipped with a stabilized 2-degree-of-freedom moving mass on top of them.The
      center of mass and head then play complementary roles that define what we call the Yoyo-Man. Beyond the two
      results presented in the paper, the Yoyo-Man model opens new perspectives to explore the computational
      foundations of anthropomorphic walking. },

    animals alike. We describe a technique to address this problem that involves a damped inclinometer, an inertial
      measurement unit mounted on an actuated orienting platform, that is a robot head, so-to-speak. Simulations show
      that a nonlinear observer based on Newton's method to solve the full dynamics of the system given inertial sensor
      data gives accurate verticality estimates even in the presence of highly dynamic perturbations that include large
      fictitious force terms. Moreover, when the sensor platform is servoed to the estimate of the gravitational
      vertical to provide for horizontal stabilization, the accuracy of the estimate is improved by almost two orders
      of magnitude. Similar gains of performance are observed even in the presence of noise and parameter
      uncertainty.},
