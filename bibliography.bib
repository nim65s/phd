  abstract={The structure of the kinematic and dynamic models of wheeled mobile robots is analyzed. It is shown that,
    for a large class of possible configurations, they can be classified into five types, characterized by generic
      structures of the model equations. For each type of model the following questions are addressed: (ir)reducibility
        and (non)holonomy, mobility and controllability, configuration of the motorization, and feedback equivalence},
