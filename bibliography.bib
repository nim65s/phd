  abstract={The structure of the kinematic and dynamic models of wheeled mobile robots is analyzed. It is shown that,
    for a large class of possible configurations, they can be classified into five types, characterized by generic
      structures of the model equations. For each type of model the following questions are addressed: (ir)reducibility
        and (non)holonomy, mobility and controllability, configuration of the motorization, and feedback equivalence},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate different possible strategies underlying the formation of human locomotor
    trajectories in goal-directed walking. Seven subjects were asked to walk within a motion capture facility from a
      fixed starting point and direction, and to cross over distant porches for which both position and direction in
      the room were changed over trials. Stereotyped trajectories were observed in the different subjects. The
      underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control scheme: the
      trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject
      being viewed as a controlled system, we tried to identify several criteria that could be optimized. Is it the
      time to perform the trajectory? The length of the path? The minimum jerk along the path? We found that the
      variation (time derivative) of the curvature of the locomotor paths is minimized. Moreover, we show that the
      human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the norm
      of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose
      curvature grows with the distance from the origin.},

  ABSTRACT = { transHumUs is an artistic work recently exhibited at the 56th Venice Biennale. The work aims at freeing
    trees from their roots. How to translate this poetic ambition into technological terms? This paper reports on the
      setup and the implementation of the project. It shows how state of the art mobile robotics technology can
      contribute to contemporary art development. The challenge has been to design original mobile platforms carrying
      charges of three tones, while moving noiseless according to tree metabolism, in operational spaces populated by
      visitors. },

  abstract={A simple and efficient randomized algorithm is presented for solving single-query path planning problems in
    high-dimensional configuration spaces. The method works by incrementally building two rapidly-exploring random
      trees (RRTs) rooted at the start and the goal configurations. The trees each explore space around them and also
      advance towards each other through, the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan
      motions for a human arm (modeled as a 7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of
      collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path
      planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 3D,
    and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3D workspace. Some basic theoretical analysis is
      also presented},
