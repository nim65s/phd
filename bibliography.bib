	abstract={The structure of the kinematic and dynamic models of wheeled mobile robots is analyzed. It is shown that,
		for a large class of possible configurations, they can be classified into five types, characterized by generic
			structures of the model equations. For each type of model the following questions are addressed: (ir)reducibility
				and (non)holonomy, mobility and controllability, configuration of the motorization, and feedback equivalence},

	abstract={In this paper, we investigate different possible strategies underlying the formation of human locomotor
		trajectories in goal-directed walking. Seven subjects were asked to walk within a motion capture facility from a
			fixed starting point and direction, and to cross over distant porches for which both position and direction in
			the room were changed over trials. Stereotyped trajectories were observed in the different subjects. The
			underlying idea to attack this question has been to relate this problem to an optimal control scheme: the
			trajectory is chosen according to some optimization principle. This is our basic starting assumption. The subject
			being viewed as a controlled system, we tried to identify several criteria that could be optimized. Is it the
			time to perform the trajectory? The length of the path? The minimum jerk along the path? We found that the
			variation (time derivative) of the curvature of the locomotor paths is minimized. Moreover, we show that the
			human locomotor trajectories are well approximated by the geodesics of a differential system minimizing the norm
			of the control. Such geodesics are made of arcs of clothoids. The clothoid or Cornu spiral is a curve, whose
			curvature grows with the distance from the origin.},
